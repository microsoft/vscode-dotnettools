## Triage Expectations

1. Issues without an "area-" label are up for grabs. If you believe you know which area an issue belongs in, please assign it.
2. After reviewing bugs in their area, teams should add the "triaged" label.
3. When adding the initial "area-" label or when changing the "area-" label, the "triaged" label should be removed. This serves as a signal to the new owners that the issue needs be looked at.
